Preparing the Insurance dataset for modeling by cleaning the data, engineering features, and conducting an in-depth exploratory analysisAfter loading the dataset, I confirmed there were no missing values, removed one duplicate row, trimmed outliers using the 1st and 99th percentiles, and transformed categorical variables using one-hot encoding to make the data fully numeric and modeling-ready. EDA revealed several clear patterns: age and BMI follow realistic distributions, medical charges are highly right-skewed, and smoker status is by far the most influential predictor of cost, showing a strong correlation with charges and an average cost difference of more than threefold compared to non-smokers. Age and BMI also contribute meaningfully, while sex, children, and region show minimal impact. Key challenges identified include the skewness of the target variable, the overwhelming influence of smoking, and the absence of detailed medical-condition data, all of which guide the modeling strategy. Based on these findings, Sprint 3 will implement linear regression, Ridge, Lasso, and tree-based models to balance predictive accuracy with interpretability, with log-transformed charges considered to address skewness.
